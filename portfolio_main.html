                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My programming journey began in May of 2023, starting with the basics learning standard programming concepts with Python. Since then I've expanded my knowledge learning how to query 
                    databases using SQL, building static websites using HTML & CSS, adding interactivity using Javascript, and saving & pushing my work using Git. Below are a few of the webpages I've built since joining Codecademy.
