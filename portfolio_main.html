            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I started my programming journey in May 0f 2023, starting with basics learning standard programming concepts with Python. Since then I've expanded my knowledge by learning how to query 
                databases using SQL, build basic websites using HTML/CSS, add interactivity using Javascript, and save/push my work using Git. Below are a few of the webpages I've built since joining Codecadey.

                    <img src="./resources/resources/Help_Guide.png">
                    <p>This webpage was one of my very first projects where the emphasis was to utilize basic HTML tables and CSS properties to make a help guide for basic HTML tags and CSS conepts for quick and
                        easy reference.</p>

                    <p>The purpose of the Blue Ridge Bakery page was to use more advance CSS properties to make this webpage pop. More vibrant colors and visuals make this webpage a realistic use case for a business</p>

                    <p>The Hendersonville Bird Club page emphasized a webpage's ability to responsively change based on the device being used, although not perfect, it does respond to some changes in formatting.</p>
